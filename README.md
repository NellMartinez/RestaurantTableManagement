# RestaurantTableManagement
Coderbyte scenario


## System Requirements
We have a restaurant with 18 tables. All tables are of varying capacity. For example, while one table can seat 4 people, another table may be able to accommodate 6 or 8. 
A table cannot be reserved in advance. When someone is granted a seat to sit in the restaurant, the restaurant manager will reserve that table in the app to block availability. 
The manager will have the ability to reserve a given table for any amount of time at his discretion. 
For example, if he notices that the table is for 2, he may allocate it for 40 minutes. If he notices that table is for a party of 9 people, he may allocate 80 minutes. This pre-set time gives the ability to see when the table will become empty. 
A table may not be empty already, but it still can be reserved at manager's discretion because he anticipates the table to become empty soon. 


The goal of the exercise is to answer a walk-in customer when the next table is available? How much is the wait time? Manager will ask to show the list of tables sorted by availability in minutes. Manager will not necessarily choose to reserve the first one in the list. He will select at his discretion based on the number of people in the group and the table capacity.
